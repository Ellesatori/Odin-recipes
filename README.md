# odin-recipes

Hi, this is my first project using all I have learned so far in TOP (with the help of other resources too).
The recipes and images used in this code came from https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/. 
I'm grateful to Ms. Lalaine in creating such a wonderful Filipino recipes blog. Kindly visit her
website for more delicious recipes. 

Thank you. Happy cooking! :)
