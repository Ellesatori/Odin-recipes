# odin-recipes

Hi, this is my first project using all I have learned so far in TOP (with the help of other resources too).
The recipes and images used in this code came from https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/. 
I'm grateful for Ms. Lalaine for having such a wonderful Filipino recipes blog. Kindly check her
blog for more delicious recipes. 

Thank you. Happy cooking! :)
