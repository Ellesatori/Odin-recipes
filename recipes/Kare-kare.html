                Rinse oxtail under cold, running water and with a knife, trim
                excess fat. In a deep pot, place oxtails and enough water to
                cover. Over medium heat, bring to a boil, skimming any scum that
                accumulates to top. Lower heat, cover and simmer, adding more
                water as needed to maintain 6 cups, for about 2 to 3 hours or
                until oxtails are easily pierced with a fork. Drain oxtail,
                reserving about 6 cups broth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Peel and discard the outer, fibrous skin layers of banana heart
                until you reach the lighter, softer core. Trim off stem and
                discard. Cut banana core into half and into fourths. In a bowl
                of cold salted water, place cut banana and soak for about 15 to
                20 minutes. Using hands, squeeze to release bitter sap. Rinse
                with cold water and drain well, discarding liquid.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a pot over medium heat, bring about 4 cups water to a boil.
                Add banana heart and blanch for about 1 minute. With a slotted
                spoon, remove from liquid and set aside. Add eggplant and blanch
                for about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and
                set aside. Add long beans and blanch for about 1 minute. With a
                slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside. Add pechay and
                blanch for about 30 seconds. With a slotted spoon, remove from
                liquid and set aside.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a skillet over medium heat, add rice flour and cook, stirring
                occasionally, until lightly browned and toasted. In a bowl,
                combine toasted rice flour and 1/4 cup reserved broth and whisk
                until smooth.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a small bowl, combine annatto powder and 1/4 cup reserved
                broth. Stir until powder is dissolved and color has dispersed.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a bowl, combine peanut butter and 1/2 cup of reserved broth
                and stir until well-blended.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic
                and cook until limp and aromatic. Add oxtail and cook, stirring
                occasionally, until lightly browned. Add fish sauce and cook for
                about 2 to 3 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the remaining 5 cups of reserved broth and bring to a
                simmer. Add annatto water, rice flour mixture and peanut butter
                mixture, stirring well to combine. Season with salt and pepper
                to taste. Continue to simmer for about 10 minutes or until it
                begins to slightly thicken. Add blanched vegetables and cook for
                about 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through and tender yet
                crisp. Serve hot with shrimp paste on the side.
